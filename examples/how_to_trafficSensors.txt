1. Open traffic_sensors.py in the IDLE (for example Visual Studio Code);
2. Make sure that the files 
- traffic_config_example.json
- lanechange2.json
- veh_sensors2.json

are in the folder 'data'
3. Run the script.

Note : If the software version changes from 0.35 to X.XX, one should edit the version number accordingly in the traffic_sensors.py file (where commented) and at the traffic_config_example.json, line 51.
